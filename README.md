# better-v6
The better-v6 (stylized as BetterV6) Kit is a project that allows the V6 kit (or, the 'ast hates fangames' kit) to be compatible with v5.5 and below Client Objects.

This project was only made possible by the hard work of the [developers of the EToH Kit](https://github.com/etohgame/kit/graphs/contributors).
