# BetterV6
The BetterV6 Kit is a project that allows the V6 kit (or, the 'ast hates fangames' kit) to be compatible with v5.5 and below Client Objects.

This is used internally in EToM *(and potentially other fangames? wink wink nudge nudge)*

This project was only made possible by the hard work of the [developers of the EToH Kit](https://github.com/etohgame/kit/graphs/contributors). Thank you!
