# better-v6
better-v6 (stylized as BetterV6) is a project that allows the V6 kit (or, the 'ast hates fangames' kit) to be compatible with v5.5 and below Client Objects.

This uses ByteNet for networking, aswell as using TopbarPlus for the timer.

This project was only made possible by the hard work of the [developers of the EToH Kit](https://github.com/etohgame/kit/graphs/contributors).
