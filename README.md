# better-v6
better-v6 (stylized as BetterV6) is a project that allows the V6 kit (or, the 'ast hates fangames' kit) to be compatible with v5.5 and below Client Objects.

This uses [ByteNet Max](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/bytenet-max-upgraded-networking-library-w-buffer-serialisation-strict-luau-and-remotefunction-support-v021/3268469) for networking, aswell as using [TopbarPlus](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/topbarplus-v331-construct-topbar-icons-with-ease-customise-them-with-themes-dropdowns-captions-labels-and-more/1017485) for the timer. It also uses [Cmdr](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/cmdr-a-fully-extensible-and-type-safe-command-console-for-roblox-developers/182815) as a command bar.

This project was only made possible by the hard work of the [developers of the EToH Kit](https://github.com/etohgame/kit/graphs/contributors).
